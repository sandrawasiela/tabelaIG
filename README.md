-	Description of application

The application is used to display the glycemic index and nutritional values of the product. 
We can find there a product that interests us and check if it is good for our health.
We classify the glycemic index into 3 groups:
- '<55' products with a low glycemic index
- '<56; 69>' products with a medium glycemic index (allowed in small quantities)
- '>70' products with a high glycemic index.
The color of the number for the glycemic index changes depending on the group it belongs to (green – low, orange – medium, red – high).  
This solution helps us avoid a sharp rise in blood glucose levels.
In addition to the glycemic index, we also have information about the content of fat, sugars, carbohydrate, protein, fibre, salt, 
cholesterol and whether the product is gluten-free. Then, if we often use specific products, we can add them to favorites and use them at a later time. When a product is no longer necessary, we can also remove it from the list of favorites.
The target group of users of our application are people who struggle with blood 
sugar / insulin disorders and want to change their eating habits.
